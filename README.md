# Deep-Learning-Specialization
## About
This repo contains all the grading programming assignments from courses in Coursera Deep Learning Specialization.
## Acknowledgement
All the programming assignments that are listed are samples of my own work in Coursera [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by `deeplearning.ai`

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)
## Incentives
All the notebooks are stored for review and revisit whenever I need a refreshment of the past course contents, it also serves as a public resource for those who encounter trouble on certain part of their programming assignments.
